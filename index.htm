<p>Every cookie made at the Kevin Cookie company is crafted with only the best ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India and the philippines. Eggs from chickens that free range. Even our water is special. It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve. Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
